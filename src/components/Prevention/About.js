      Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly
      discovered coronavirus.
    </Text>

    <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
      Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience mild to
      moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special
      treatment.&nbsp; Older people, and those with underlying medical problems
      like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and
      cancer are more likely to develop serious illness.
    </Text>

    <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
      The best way to prevent and slow down transmission is be well informed
      about the COVID-19 virus, the disease it causes and how it spreads.
      Protect yourself and others from infection by washing your hands or using
      an alcohol based rub frequently and not touching your face.&nbsp;
    </Text>

    <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
      The COVID-19 virus spreads primarily through droplets of saliva or
      discharge from the nose when an infected person coughs or sneezes, so itâ€™s
      important that you also practice respiratory etiquette (for example, by
      coughing into a flexed elbow).
    </Text>

    <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
      At this time, there are no specific vaccines or treatments for COVID-19.
      However, there are many ongoing clinical trials evaluating potential
      treatments. WHO will continue to provide updated information as soon as
      clinical findings become available.
